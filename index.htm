            <p>
                We are a gaming guild for <strong>OGAT, Payday 2, Elder Scrolls Online, Terraria and Omniwar</strong>, founded in March 2014. Starting from a small group of friends on Mibbit, we first moved to Skype and later on to Discord where we have had a working and active server for more than a year already. We are more than just a place to play games together - our goal is to create long lasting friendships where people will be there for each other, a place for if someone needs help, advice or just wants to share his/her happiness with others.
                <br> 
                For more information about our leaders and moderators check <a href='moderation.htm'>moderation page</a>. If you are interested in our members, check the <a href='#rules'>rules page which also have our members listed</a>, want to see our rules? check the <a href='#rules'>rules page</a>, and if you want to know more about the games we play, go to our <a href='games.htm'>games page</a>.
